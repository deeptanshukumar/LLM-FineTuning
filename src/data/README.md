# Dataset Documentation for Gemma 3 270m Fine-Tuning

This README file provides essential information regarding the dataset used for fine-tuning the Gemma 3 270m model. 

## Dataset Sources
- Describe the sources of your dataset here. For example, you might use publicly available datasets from platforms like Kaggle, Hugging Face Datasets, or custom datasets you have collected.

## Preprocessing Steps
- Outline the preprocessing steps that need to be applied to the dataset before training. This may include:
  - Data cleaning (removing duplicates, handling missing values)
  - Text normalization (lowercasing, removing special characters)
  - Tokenization (converting text into tokens suitable for the model)

## Data Structure
- Explain how the data should be structured for training. For example:
  - The dataset should be in CSV format with columns such as `text` and `label`.
  - Provide an example of how a few rows of the dataset should look.

## Usage
- Provide instructions on how to load and use the dataset in your fine-tuning scripts or notebooks. This may include code snippets demonstrating how to read the dataset and prepare it for training.

## Additional Notes
- Include any additional information that may be relevant, such as licensing information for the dataset or any specific considerations for using the data with the Gemma model.
